/*!
    Write an FFMETADATA1 file containing navigation information.

    This is FFmpeg's generic metadata format, and can be used to provide
    metadata for chapter-supporting formats like Matroska.
    Format description: <https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#Metadata-1>

    @param startFrameOneBased Optional 1-based start frame for range export.
           Pass a value < 1 to export from the first frame.
    @param lengthFrames Optional frame length for range export.
           Pass a value < 1 to export to the end of the input.
    @param includeVitcTimecode When true, include FFmpeg-style VITC timecode
           in the output header when available.

    Returns true on success, false on failure.
